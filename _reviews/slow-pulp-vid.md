<p> Hello freaks. God damn, Slow Pulp is a really really good band. This week, the group released an ethereal power-sad ballad, “Falling Apart”, off of their upcoming album “Moveys”. The track came accompanied by an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuoFLLHB1Fc">incredible music video</a>; I love when the really good bands do that. 
 </p>
<p> Key to this track are the beautiful violin parts played by Molly Germer, a frequent Alex G collaborator, which add an elegant depth to the arrangement. Emily Massey’s contemplative vocals float along, peeking its head just above the surface for a look around.

<p>“Why don’t you go back/to falling apart,/you were so good at that”, she laments in the chorus, perhaps narrating a depressive internal monologue. The lyrics also mention “feeling like a deadbeat”, needing to “step up”, and the struggle to be enough, which further suggest that the song is more a message directed towards oneself as opposed to an external subject.  </p>
<p> This lyrical theme, along with the dreamy arrangement, give the listener a sense of just floating through it all, not really in control of where they’re going. As if we were all stuck in a pandemic or something like that.
 </p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, Slow Pulp decided to release this single with its music video simultaneously, and in the opinion of this amateur music journalist, it paid off bigtime. 
</p>
<p>The film’s moving-collage animation brings a fever-dream twist to the early days of MTV’s music video catalogue. The viewer gets that same sense of floating or levitating through, a la Jeff Bridges in that classic Big Lebowski bowling dream sequence, featuring Kenny Rogers’ “I Just Dropped In (To See What Condition… etc.)”

</p>
<p>In one of my favorite sequences, the sun doubles as a yellow ball on a chain that swings in between Massey and the viewer’s face, as the sky quickly rises in the background like a sheet of paper. The producers, Powered By Wind, were keen to blend real and animated textures together into this trippy, engaging tapestry.

</p>
<p>In a poignant scene, Massey searches for the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle, in a warbly house. Also, how did the animators get that shot of the puzzle piece from that underneath perspective? Powered By Wind, feel free to email me. I am so curious. </p>
<p>Based on what we’ve heard so far, this Slow Pulp album is as highly anticipated as anything the group has put out before. I preordered the <a href="https://slowpulp.bandcamp.com/album/moveys">cassette</a> so fast, and so should you.
