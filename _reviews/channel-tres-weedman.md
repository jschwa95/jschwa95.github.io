Hello Vom’ers! It’s me, Lancelot. Here is my semi-whenever round-up of songs I like.

<h4> <i> Channel Tres - Weedman </i></h4>
<br>
<p> Channel “Put Some Sub In That Bitch” Tres has returned with an infectious marijuana-themed single. Well–ok I’ll come clean–it was released months ago, but this blog just started, and I want to write about it, so there. Sheldon Young, the solo artist behind Channel Tres, received praise in 2018 for his eponymous EP, which brought a west-coast spin to Detroit House. </p>
<p> "Weedman" features that fat, bubbly sub-bass we've come to expect from Tres, but on top of a more downtempo beat, giving the track a more mellow vibe to fit the song's subject matter. </p>

<p>Young takes on different perspectives in the verses, including a customer desperate to buy some weed, and the overwhelmed weedman himself. It's a clever juxposition that makes the track particularly entertaining.  </p>
<p> He and co-producer Nick Sylvester also showcase their ability to subtly layer analog and digital sounds together. This includes a landline-phone-like synth sound, which serves as a thematic gesture, as well as a catchy lead part. Every so often, a single low piano note penetrates the mix, ever so smoothly.    </p>
<p>The single is a unique addition Channel's discography, that also shows off his flexibility as an M.C.
