# Zach's Review


Kevin & the Zits has rediscovered *and* reinvented the long lost sound of the great post-punk era. I would even go as far to say they are post "post-punk". With the ting of a cymbal, the screech of the guitar, and the boom boom of the bass drum, Kevin & the Zits serenade the masses with songs that reflect the past and foretell the future.
