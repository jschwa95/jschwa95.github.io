excerpt: Get whisked away to the wonderful world of drum + bass

Hi, I’m DJ Denim Dill, welcome to Jackass.

The other day I tweeted about getting really into drum & bass while in quar partly as a joke, but there is truth in that my damaged brain matter has fully congealed around this wonderful music. While I've definitely had my fill of ambient and drone and folk and other more still sounds, d&b in particular has become something like a comfort during these uncertain times. Something to turn to when the days are so long but the weeks fly by.

I think I can pinpoint why. 

 At its onset, d&b-–much like many other dance sub genres if you didn’t already know–was rooted in strife and political unrest. It was often a reflection of socially turbulent times in the UK as well as an escape. 

And it was FAST, blisteringly so.

It was also a sound relegated to particular clubs (that were often raided) and initially siloed from media portrayals of dance music for proposed “lawlessness” or whatever other coded language is used by the puritanical powers that be to “protect” society from unrest. 

This sort of thing wasn’t left in the 90’s either, in case you were wondering. 

Even today there’s a certain righteous fury to d&b that feels at home in quar. It’s hard to describe, but I feel deep down that it differs from the nu metal-ian angst of big room EDM. It’s an anger that is both pointed and yet open-ended enough to be applied to the various and seemingly unending ills plaguing the world around us at all times. 

The kinds we can’t escape because there is no escape, you HAVE to stay inside right now. 

Also, did I mention d&b is fast? This stuff is dizzyingly fun to listen to, and even more so to mix. Which is the point.

Being unemployed during this stretch and having very little to do other than read about the daily atrocities cooked up by the ruling classes of the world has its downsides! #bummer

Any sort of hobby has been a welcome distraction, and I’m sure plenty of us could use an hour or so off from the salt mines (that’s what I sometimes call doom scrolling through the timeline when my partner or someone else important to me asks what I’m doing). 

So here, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dillon-riley/dj-denim-dill-vom-blog-mix-01" style="color: yellow">take this </a>hour of fun (mostly) brand new dance music from me to you.
