Welcome to <strong> Vom!</strong> We are a modest music blog that attempts to bring a more chaotic and accessible approach to music journalism.


Content will include interviews, reviews, premieres, features and probably some other fun stuff. As our home page says, the possibilities are truly endless.


We're always looking for writers. Email pitches to <a href="mailto:unclesteveshows@gmail.com"> unclesteveshows@gmail.com, </a> with the subject "vom pitch".

If you want us to hear your music, email <a href="mailto:jschwa95@gmail.com"> jschwa95@gmail.com </a> with the subject "demo submission" and your artist name.
